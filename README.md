## Log

### 17 Dec 2022

A quick retrospective on the 2022 Advent-of-Code so far:

1. I've been happy that I have kept such a strong streak for the first half of Advent-of-Code. Up until day 16, I've only really had minor issues and most puzzles have been solvable in less than 3 hours. In my eyes, I'm not a fast programmer, so I'm proud of this. For the first 16 days or so, I was actually in the top-5 on two separate private leaderboards that I was apart of. I expect to lose this standing pretty soon but I thought I'd record for my own prideful posterity 😊.

2. It's day 18 today, and I won't be around to solve the problem when it first becomes available at 9PM my time. I won't have free time to solve it until midnight-ish, and I probably won't prioritize it over sleep so I may just skip today entirely. I think that's how I'll have to proceed with the rest of this year's Advent-of-Code. I just don't have the desire to maintain 25 days straight of 9PM->11:30PM programming through my vacation and days 22->25, I'll be the central time zone (and busy) so it'll be harder. Oh well! It's been fun being pretty rigorous so far, but I think this is the way to keep it fun rather than a chore.

3. This year has been a good opportunity to play around with some different languages. The last time I participated, I did this all in Rust. This year (2022), I started with C then moved onto using Odin. I also briefly demo'd using Zig, but seemed to stick to Odin slightly more for some reason. Not sure why. Zig is nice too and all of the things I like about Odin, I also like about Zig.

4. This year has also been a good opportunity to do the kind of haphazard programming that I find fun and relaxing. Low/no-stakes and I'm not hyper criticizing my solutions with questions of memory safety, performance, or external readability. I haven't taken the time to validate what issues might exist (that's sort of half the point), but I'm sure there'd be plenty of issues.

I hope the rest of Advent-of-Code continues to be fun!
